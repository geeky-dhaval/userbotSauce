### If the CI builds pass, but you still get syntax errors when running locally it's most probably not a problem with the source but with your version of python

- Your Telegram account may get banned.
- I am not responsible for any improper use of this bot
- This bot is intended for the purpose of having fun with memes
- as well as efficiently managing groups
- You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
- and the Telegram Team deleted your account?
- And then you pointed your fingers at me for getting yourself reported?
- I will laugh at you.

A modular telegram Python UserBot running on python3 with an sqlalchemy database.

Started up as a simple bot, which helps with deleting messages and other stuffs when I didn't possess a smartphone(selecting each message indeed difficult) with a ton of meme features kanged from [SkittBot](https://github.com/skittles9823/SkittBot), it has evolved, becoming extremely modular and simple to use.
